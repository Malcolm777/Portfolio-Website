    "aboutme":"I'm a senior computer science student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. At university, I've completed projects in C++, Java, and Python. This past summer 2022, I interned at AIG as a technology analyst intern, working on the application security team. I also supported a full-stack engineer with defect fixes and creating RESTful applications in Java, Spring, and SQL/PostgreSQL. Currently, I'm in my last semester virtually, on a half-time schedule, so I'm searching for back-end dev and/or full-stack dev opportunities. I love to automate and create products that make life easier.",
